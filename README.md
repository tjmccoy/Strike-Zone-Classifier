# Project Name

Strike Zone Classifier

## Overview

An image classification script using TensorFlow and Keras. It includes functions for data preprocessing,
model building, training, evaluation, and visualization. The script also removes images with invalid formats from
the dataset and showcases the training performance using TensorBoard.
